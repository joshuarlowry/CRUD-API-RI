# CRUD-API-RI
CRUD API reference implementation
This is a **reference implementation** demonstrating a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. It showcases:

## What This Demonstrates

### üèóÔ∏è **Modern Python Web Development**
- **FastAPI** for high-performance API development with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0** with async support for database operations
- **Pydantic** models for request/response validation and serialization
- **Aiosqlite** for async SQLite database access

### üìä **Database Design**
- **Contact management** with fields: first_name, last_name, email, phone, notes
- **Email uniqueness** constraint with proper error handling (409 Conflict)
- **Auto-generated IDs** and timestamps
- **SQLite** database for simplicity (easily swappable for PostgreSQL/MySQL)

### üîß **API Best Practices**
- **RESTful endpoints** following HTTP conventions
- **Proper status codes** (201 Created, 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict, etc.)
- **Input validation** with Pydantic schemas
- **Error handling** with meaningful HTTP exceptions
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** documentation auto-generated

### üéØ **Developer Experience**
- **Interactive API docs** at `/docs` (Swagger UI)
- **Web-based test interface** at `/ui` for manual CRUD testing
- **Dev container** setup for consistent development environment
- **Hot reload** during development

### üß™ **Testing & Validation**
- **Manual test UI** with pre-built CRUD operations
- **Real-time API testing** without external tools
- **Error scenario testing** (duplicate emails, missing records)

This implementation serves as a **production-ready template** for building similar CRUD APIs, demonstrating both the technical implementation and developer-friendly features that make FastAPI a popular choice for modern web development.

## Running the FastAPI CRM Service

1. **Launch the Dev Container**
   * Open this project in VS Code and select **"Reopen in Container"** when prompted.

2. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. **Explore the API**
   * Visit http://localhost:8000/docs for the interactive Swagger UI.
   * CRUD endpoints are available under the **/contacts** path.

4. **Database**
   * SQLite file `crm.db` will be generated at the project root on first run.

### Example Requests

Create:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/contacts \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"first_name":"Ada","last_name":"Lovelace","email":"ada@example.com"}'
```

Retrieve:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/contacts/1
```

Update:
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/contacts/1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"phone":"555-1234"}'
```

Delete:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/contacts/1 -i
```

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., **404** for missing contacts, **409** on duplicate email).

## Web-based CRUD Test UI

Want to play with the API without crafting curl commands? After the server is running, open:

```
http://localhost:8000/ui
```

That page is a lightweight HTML/JS harness (see `frontend/index.html`) that exposes several one-click tests:

* **List contacts** ‚Äì `GET /contacts`
* **Create contact** ‚Äì `POST /contacts` with a unique email each click
* **Get contact 1** ‚Äì `GET /contacts/1` (will return *404* if no such record)
* **Delete missing contact** ‚Äì `DELETE /contacts/9999` expects *404*

Each action streams the full request and response‚Äîincluding status code‚Äîinto a console pane so you can watch what happens in real-time.

Feel free to duplicate any block in `tests` inside the page to add more scenarios.
